# OfflineReader-For-Reddit

OfflineReader For Reddit is an Android app that allows you to download Reddit threads for offline viewing. The way it works is that you just add a subreddit (e.g. r/aww, r/funny, r/pics, etc.) to your list and start the download. The app will then save the threads that have been downloaded on your phone and you will be able to view them even without an internet connection. You can delete any threads from your phone any time you want. The app also allows you to filter which threads to download by letting you create a list of keywords. Only threads whose titles contain a word from your list will be downloaded.

The app is currently for viewing threads only and does not support logging into your Reddit account if you have any.
